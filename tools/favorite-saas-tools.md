 Favorite SaaS Tools for Early‑Stage Teams

1. Notion  – For docs, wikis, and pretending your internal chaos is under control.
2. Slack – For over‑communicating in multiple channels at once.
3. Linear or Jira – Pick your poison. Just track your work.
4. Loom– Async video = fewer meetings = happiness.
5. Figma– So designers can argue in real time.
6. Stripe – For actually making money (eventually).
7. Segment – Pipe your data into 100 places you may or may not check.

Use what works. Ignore what doesn’t. Just don’t build your own project management tool. Again.
