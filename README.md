👤 About
Created by a startup advisor with more experience than most teams combined. Built to save time, cut nonsense, and help avoid the thousand dumb decisions standing between you and product-market fit.

"Steal this repo. Fork it. Clone it. Print it out and frame it. I won’t stop you."



A Note
This toolkit won’t save your startup, but it might stop you from crashing it into the side of a VC-funded mountain.


Made with ❤️ by Trish Emhof. In Markdown. On purpose.
