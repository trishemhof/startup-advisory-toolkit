Infrastructure vs. Product Focus: Spending Money Wisely

Earlyâ€‘Stage Rule:**
Donâ€™t overâ€‘invest in infra if your product isnâ€™t even validated. Resilience is meaningless if no one wants your thing.

Balance It Out:
| If Youâ€™re Doing This             | But Not This                         | Youâ€™re Probably Wasting Time |
|----------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|
| Optimizing latency              | Tracking churn                      | ðŸ¤¡                           |
| Building CI/CD pipelines        | Testing onboarding flows            | ðŸ¤¯                           |
| Fancy dashboards                | Talking to users                    | ðŸ˜±                           |

Ship ugly. Learn fast. Then get fancy.
