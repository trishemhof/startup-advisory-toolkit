Hiring Strategy: How Not to Hire a Disaster

1. Hire for stage, not fantasy.
You're not Google. You're not even Medium. Don’t hire like you are. Prioritize generalists who can ship, learn, and adapt.

2. Culture fit ≠ clone army.
Look for alignment in values, not vibes. Disagreement is a feature, not a bug.

3. Pay attention to how they handle ambiguity.
Startups are 70% fog, 20% chaos, and 10% pizza. You want people who can navigate that.

4. Run simulations, not interviews.
Give real‑world problems, not “what's your biggest weakness” nonsense.

5. Overcommunicate expectations.
Early misalignment = late‑stage disasters. Be obnoxiously clear about roles and deliverables.
