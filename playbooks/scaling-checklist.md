Scaling Checklist: Things You Forget When Things Start Working
- [ ] Team roles are clearly defined
- [ ] Onboarding exists (and isn’t just someone yelling in Slack)
- [ ] Documentation is updated at least once per epoch
- [ ] Your infrastructure can handle 10× load (without weeping)
- [ ] Metrics dashboards that someone actually looks at
- [ ] Customer support isn’t just a shared inbox with 9,000 emails
- [ ] A plan for internal communication that’s not total chaos
- [ ] Legal and compliance? Yeah, it’s time.
