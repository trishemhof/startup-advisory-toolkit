Positioning Framework: Sound Smarter Than You Are

Step 1: Define the enemy.
What are you replacing? (Excel, Google Docs, someone's cousin's web tool.)

Step 2: Nail the “why now?”
Why should anyone care today? Market shift, new tech, post‑pandemic trend?

tep 3: Craft your one‑liner.
“We help [X] do [Y] so they can [Z].”

Step 4: Emotional + Rational appeal.
Logic wins demos. Emotion closes deals. Use both.

Step 5: Test, revise, repeat.**
You won’t get it right the first time. Or second. Embrace the loop.
